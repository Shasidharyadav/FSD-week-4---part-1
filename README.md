Letâ€™s consider a real-world scenario where we have a list of employees in an organization and we want to perform various tasks using JavaScript:

Create an Employee Object:

Each employee should be represented as an object with these attributes.
Calculate Average Salary:
Write a function that takes an array of employee objects as input and calculates the average salary of all employees.
Find Employees in a Department:
Write a function that takes an array of employee objects and a department name as input.
Return an array containing all employees who belong to the specified department.
Increase Salary for Employees:
Write a function that takes an array of employee objects and a percentage increase as input.
Increase the salary of each employee in the array by the specified percentage.
Sort Employees by Age:
Write a function that takes an array of employee objects and sorts them based on their age in ascending order.
Return the sorted array of employee objects.
